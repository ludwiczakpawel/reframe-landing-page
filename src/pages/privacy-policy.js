            The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us
            to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your

              <strong>Legitimate Interests.</strong> We may process your
              information when we believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve
              our legitimate business interests and those interests do not
              outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For
              example, we may process your personal information for some of the
